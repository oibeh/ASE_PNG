# Investigating allele-specific expression and archaic introgression in Papua New Guinean populations
This repo contains the necessary processing and analysis code to reproduce the results in "Investigating allele-specific expression and archaic introgression in Papua New Guinean populations".

`ASE_QC.R`: Summary and annotation of WASP output + ASE QC stats and plots
`PNG_introgression.R`: Filter and tabulate archaic SNPs and haplotypes across PNG individuals
`PNG_introgression_annot.R`: Genomic annotation of archaic SNPs
`ASE_and_introgression.R`: Intersection of ASE and archaic SNPs + ASE enrichment tests at introgressed and non-introgressed SNPs
`aseQTL.R`: aseQTL rank permutation testing and effect size analysis
